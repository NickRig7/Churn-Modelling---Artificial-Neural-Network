# Churn-Modelling-Artificial-Neural-Network

The dataset I am working with is from finance industry.  The dataset contains a total dimensions of 14 variables across 5181 observations.

The task to be performed is to construct an artificial neural network that takes into account all independent variables and predict whether or not our 
customer will leave the bank.
